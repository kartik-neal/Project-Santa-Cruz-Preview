# Advanced development with Project Santa Cruz

## Get started with the advanced development tutorials

The provided [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/microsoft/Project-Santa-Cruz-Private-Preview/blob/main/Sample-Scripts-and-Notebooks/Official/Machine%20Learning%20Notebooks/Transferlearningusing_SSDLiteV2%20Model.ipynb) performs transfer learning using a pre-trained TensorFlow model (MobileNetSSDV2Lite) on AzureML in Python with a custom dataset to detect bowls. There are two tutorial options to guide you through working with the notebook to train and deploy your bowl detector to the Project Santa Cruz devkit:

- [Cloud development](https://github.com/microsoft/Project-Santa-Cruz-Private-Preview/blob/main/Sample-Scripts-and-Notebooks/Official/Machine%20Learning%20Notebooks/advanced_development_cloud.md): in this tutorial, you will run the notebook in the [Azure Machine Learning Portal](https://ml.azure.com) with a remote compute instance.

- [Local development](https://github.com/microsoft/Project-Santa-Cruz-Private-Preview/blob/main/Sample-Scripts-and-Notebooks/Official/Machine%20Learning%20Notebooks/advanced_development_local.md): in this tutorial, you will run the notebook locally within VS Code with a remote compute instance.
