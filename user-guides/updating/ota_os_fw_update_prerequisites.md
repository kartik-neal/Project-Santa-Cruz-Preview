# OTA OS and FW Update Prerequisites

1. Toggle Azure Device Update (ADU) on. This can be accomplished through the [onboarding](https://github.com/microsoft/Project-Santa-Cruz-Private-Preview/blob/main/user-guides/getting_started/azure-subscription-onboarding.md) process or in your [Azure account](https://ms.portal.azure.com/?feature.canmodifystamps=true&Microsoft_Azure_Iothub=aduprod#home) after onboarding has been completed. After turning on ADU, please wait 5 business days for the service to propagate to your Azure account.
