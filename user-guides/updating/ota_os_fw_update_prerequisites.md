# OTA OS and FW Update Prerequisites

1. Toggle Azure Device Update (ADU) on. This can be accomplished through the [onboarding website](https://github.com/microsoft/Project-Santa-Cruz-Private-Preview/blob/main/user-guides/getting_started/azure-subscription-onboarding.md). After turning on ADU, please wait 5 business days for the service to propagate to your Azure account.

1. Add the ADU service principal within your AAD tenant. Launch PowerShell and run the following commands with Azure AD Admin permissions (if you do not have Azure AD Admin permissions, please contact your organization's admin):

    1. "Install-Module AzureAD" (if you donâ€™t already have this Powershell Module)
    
    1. "Connect-AzureAD"
    
    1. "New-AzureADServicePrincipal -AppId '6ee392c4-d339-4083-b04d-6b7947c6cf78'"

1. Assign ADU roles to users who will be performing ADU OTA updates. Currently, ADU supports FullAccessAdmin and ReadOnlyAdmin. To assign ADU roles for users, do the following:

    1. Sign in to the Azure portal.
    
    1. Select Azure Active Directory.
    
    1. Select Enterprise applications.
    
    1. On the Enterprise applications - All applications pane, change the Application Type to 'Microsoft Applications' and click Apply.
    
    1. Search for the Azure Device Update application by name or by ID (application ID: 6ee392c4-d339-4083-b04d-6b7947c6cf78). Select Azure Device Update.
    
    1. On the Azure Device Update pane, select 'Users & Groups'.
    
    1. On the Azure Device Update 'User & Groups' pane, select 'Add user'.
    
    1. On the 'Add Assignment' pane, select a user or a group.
    
    1. On the 'Add Assignment' pane, select Role and add either 'Allow full access to ADU management APIs' or 'Allow read-only access to ADU management APIs'.
    
    1. Select the 'Assign' button at the bottom of the pane.

1. Once you have completed the steps above, you will be able to use Azure Device Update by navigating to the Azure Portal using this [link](https://portal.azure.com/?feature.canmodifystamps=true&Microsoft_Azure_Iothub=aduprod). This link turns on Azure Device Update functionality, given that this is a Private Preview feature.

1. You are now ready to deploy your first OS/FW update over-the-air, learn more how to do it in the next part of this guide:  [Over-the-air OS/FW Updating](https://github.com/microsoft/Project-Santa-Cruz-Private-Preview/blob/main/user-guides/updating/ota_update.md).
