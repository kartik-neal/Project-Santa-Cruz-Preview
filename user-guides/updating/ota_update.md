# Over-the-air (OTA) updating

With Project Santa Cruz, you can update your devkit carrier board software over-the-air (OTA) or via [USB](https://github.com/microsoft/Project-Santa-Cruz-Private-Preview/blob/main/user-guides/updating/usb_updating.md). This guide will walk you through the OTA update process. Prior to executing an OTA update, you must set up an IoT Hub for use with Project Santa Cruz (part of onboarding), connect your devkit to a Wi-Fi network (part of OOBE), and provision your devkit to your Project Santa Cruz IoT Hub (part of OOBE). For a full list of prerequisites, please see the next section.

## Prerequisites

- Host PC.
- Project Santa Cruz Development Kit.
- [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html).
- [Onboarding](https://github.com/microsoft/Project-Santa-Cruz-Private-Preview/blob/main/user-guides/getting_started/azure-subscription-onboarding.md) complete with ADU enabled (please wait 2 business days after completing this).
- [OOBE](https://github.com/microsoft/Project-Santa-Cruz-Private-Preview/blob/main/user-guides/getting_started/oobe.md) complete.
- [General OTA Update Prerequisites](https://github.com/microsoft/Project-Santa-Cruz-Private-Preview/blob/main/user-guides/updating/ota_os_fw_update_prerequisites.md) have been satisfied.

## Getting started

1. Plug in and power on your devkit.

1. On your PC, navigate to the [Project Santa Cruz update management website](https://projectsantacruz.microsoft.com/Download). Download the image file (.swu) and manifest file (.json) of your desired update.

## Create a group

Azure Device Update allows you to deploy an update to a group of IoT devices. To create a group, you must add a tag to your target set of devices in IoT Hub. Follow the steps outlined below to add and update a tag.

**NOTE**: If you have already created a group, you can skip directly to the next section, **Deploy an update**.

 Limitations:

  - You can add any value to your tag except for "Uncategorized," which is a reserved value.
  - Tag value cannot exceed 255 characters.
  - Tag value can only contain these special characters: “.”,”-“,”_”,”~”.
  - Tag and group names are case sensitive.
  - A device can only have one tag. Any subsequent tag added to the device will override the previous tag.
  - A device can only belong to one group.

### Method 1: using direct twin updates to add a tag (easy)

Tags can also be added or updated in device twin directly.

1. Log into the Azure Portal using [this link](https://ms.portal.azure.com/?feature.canmodifystamps=true&Microsoft_Azure_Iothub=aduprod#home) and navigate to your IoT Hub.

2. From **IoT Edge** on the left navigation pane, find your Project Santa Cruz device and navigate to the Device Twin.

3. In the Device Twin, delete any existing ADU tag value by setting them to null.

4. Add a new ADU tag value as shown below. Learn more about device twin JSON document tags [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-device-twins#device-twins).

```JSON
"tags": {
"ADUGroup": "<CustomTagValue>"
}
```

### Method 2: using jobs to add a tag (advanced)

1. Follow [these steps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-csharp-csharp-schedule-jobs) to add a tag to your devices using Jobs.

    **NOTE**: Tags can only be successfully added to your device after it has been connected to ADU. It is possible to schedule a Job on multiple devices to add or update their Device Update tags. To do so, please follow [these examples](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-jobs).

    **NOTE**: This action may exceed your current daily IoT Hub message quota. It is recommended to change no more than 50,000 device twin tags at a time, otherwise you may need to buy additional IoT Hub units. Details can be found at [Quotas and throttling](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-quotas-throttling#quotas-and-throttling).

1. Create a group by selecting an existing IoT Hub tag:

    1. Navigate back to your IoT Hub page.

    1. Select **Device Updates** under **Automatic Device Management** on the left-hand menu panel.

    1. Select the **Groups** tab. This page will display the number of ungrouped devices connected to Device Update.

        ![ota_groups](./images/ota_groups.png)

    1. Select **+ Add** to create a new group.

    1. Select an IoT Hub tag from the list and click **Submit**.

        ![ota_create_group](./images/ota_create_group.png)

    1. Once the group is created, the update compliance chart and groups list will update. The chart shows the number of devices in various states of compliance: **On latest update**, **New updates available**, **Updates in progress**, and **Not yet grouped**.

        ![ota_groups_tags](./images/ota_groups_tags.png)

## Deploy an update

1. You should see your newly created group with a new update listed under **Available updates** (you may need to refresh once). Select the update.

1. Confirm that the correct device group is selected as the target device group. Select a **Start date** and **Start time** for your deployment, then click **Create deployment**.

    ![ota_create_deployment](./images/ota_create_deployment.png)

1. Check the compliance chart. You should see the update is now in progress.

    ![ota_device_update_in_progress](./images/ota_device_update_in_progress.png)

1. After your update has completed, your compliance chart will reflect your new update status.

    ![ota_device_update_complete](./images/ota_device_update_complete.png)

1. Select the **Deployments** tab at the top of the **Device updates** page.

    ![ota_deployments](./images/ota_deployments.png)

1. Select your deployment to view the deployment details. You may need to click **Refresh** until the **Status** changes to **Succeeded**.

    ![ota_deployment_details](./images/ota_deployment_details.png)

## Update confirmation

1. To verify that the correct update was installed, navigate back to the **Device Twin** page for your devkit (IoT Hub > Automatic Device Management > IoT Edge > Device Twin). **swVersion** will display the current software, which should match the update that was just installed.

    ![device_twin_updated](https://github.com/microsoft/Project-Santa-Cruz-Private-Preview/blob/main/user-guides/updating/images/ota_device_twin_updated.png)

1. As an additional verification step, SSH into your devkit to check the ADU software version.

    1. First, connect to the devkit's SoftAP (default password = santacruz).

        ![wifi_ap](https://github.com/microsoft/Project-Santa-Cruz-Private-Preview/blob/main/user-guides/updating/images/ota_wifi_ap.png)  

    1. Open PuTTY. Enter the following and click **Open** to SSH into your devkit:

        1. Host Name: 10.1.1.1
        1. Port: 22
        1. Connection Type: SSH

        ![putty](https://github.com/microsoft/Project-Santa-Cruz-Private-Preview/blob/main/user-guides/updating/images/ota_putty.png)  

    1. Log in to the PuTTY terminal. If you set up an SSH username and password during the [OOBE]( https://github.com/microsoft/Project-Santa-Cruz-Private-Preview/blob/main/user-guides/getting_started/oobe.md), enter those login credentials when prompted. Otherwise, enter the following:  

        1. login as: root
        1. Password: p@ssw0rd

    1. Enter the following in the PuTTY terminal:

        ```console
        cat /etc/adu-version
        ```

        The terminal will display the current software version, which should match the installed update.
