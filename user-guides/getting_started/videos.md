# Getting Started Videos

The getting started videos are quick overviews of key components of the Project Santa Cruz experience.

There are two ways to view the videos.

1. Stream the videos via Microsoft Teams
2. Download the videos file from the repository

## Stream the videos via Microsoft Teams
This the preferred way to view the videos as it prevents the video files from needing to be downloaded on multiple machines. To view the videos you must be added to the Project Santa Cruz Private Preview Team. If you have not been added to the Team, send an email to aedppsup@microsoft.com and the support team will get you added.

## Download the video from the repository
If you are unable to watch via Microsoft Teams, you can download the video files and watch it locally on your computer. Keep in mind that that these videos are provided under NDA and they should not be shared. Best practice is to delete the video from your machine when finished watching it.
