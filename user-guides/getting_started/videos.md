# Getting Started Videos

The getting started videos are quick overviews of key components of the Project Santa Cruz experience.

## Stream the videos via Microsoft Teams
This the preferred way to view the videos as it prevents the video files from needing to be downloaded on multiple machines. To view the videos you must be added to the Project Santa Cruz Private Preview Teams channel.
