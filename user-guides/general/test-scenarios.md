# Project Santa Cruz Quests

We have prepared a series of experiences for you to try out. Your participation running these scenarios and your subsequent feedback will help us continue to fine-tune and improve these experiences. We highly encourage you to make time early in the program to take part in this testing and give us your feedback.

## Getting started: go through advanced settings within OOBE (devkit)

Purpose of this Quest: utilize the advanced settings within the out-of-box experience (OOBE). Define a static IP, define a DNS server, and define the Internet Proxy Server.

Expected outcome: the advanced network settings should work seamlessly and intuitively for advanced network users.

Experience documentation: [OOBE walkthrough](https://github.com/microsoft/Project-Santa-Cruz-Private-Preview/blob/main/user-guides/getting_started/oobe.md).

Questionnaire: please provide feedback [here](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbRzoJxrXKT0dEvfQyxsA0h8lUOEpDRkxZSUFWMFc2SEZYMDBBSlVQMUZMMy4u).

## Operation: update experiences (devkit)

Purpose of this Quest: update your device OS and firmware via the following three methods:

    1. Over-the-air OS update (carrier board)
    1. USB OS update (carrier board)
    1. Over-the-air firmware update (Eye/Ear SoM)

Expected outcome: successful OS/FW updates of devkit components.

## Guided experiences: no-code journey (speech)

Purpose of this Quest: create a voice assistant application using the Project Santa Cruz devkit and speech services.

Expected outcome: successfully create a voice assistant application using one of the templates, configure a custom keyword, and use voice assistant to control devices in a virtual room.

## Guided experiences: no-code journey (vision)

Purpose of this Quest: build your own vision AI solution and deploy it to your Project Santa Cruz devkit.

Expected outcome: successfully collect data, label data, train a model, and deploy the model to the devkit. Learn how to improve your model performance, analyze patterns, and set up alerts through various Azure Services.

## Guided experiences: advanced tools (devtoolkit)

Purpose of this Quest: use guided journey samples to get started with advanced AI development in the cloud using AML + Jupyter Notebooks and locally using VS Code.

Expected outcome: successfully train and deploy object detection models to the Project Santa Cruz devkit using TensorFlow on the AML platform.
