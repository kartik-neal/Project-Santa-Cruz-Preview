# How to Ask For Support

In the event you get blocked for any reason or if you have a question, you can get support via a couple of methods. 

1. Open a GitHub Issue (our preferred method)

	We prefer you use this method of asking for support becaus your request can be easily seen by our entire product team as well as the rest of the Private Preview community. Not only does it potentially increase speed in which your request or question gets answered, it is also visible to anyone else who has the same issue.

	To open a support request, 

	- click here to launch the Issues page
	- search the existing issues to see if it has been addressed for a another user
	- if not, click the "New" button
	- enter the details of you issue or question

2. Contact your dedicated PM - When your issue or question contains information you don't want shared with the community you can direct it to your dedicated PM helper who can help you out.
