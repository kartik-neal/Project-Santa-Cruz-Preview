# Project Santa Cruz development kit troubleshooting

## General devkit troubleshooting commands

To run these commands, connect to the devkit's Wi-Fi AP (if a Wi-Fi connection has not yet been set up through the [OOBE](https://github.com/microsoft/Project-Santa-Cruz-Private-Preview/blob/main/user-guides/getting_started/oobe.md)), [SSH into the devkit using PuTTY](https://github.com/microsoft/Project-Santa-Cruz-Private-Preview/blob/main/user-guides/general/troubleshooting/ssh_and_serial_connection_setup.md), and enter the commands in the PuTTY terminal.

To redirect any output to a .txt file for further analysis, use the following syntax:

```console
[command] > [file name].txt
```

After redirecting output to a .txt file, copy the file to your host PC via SCP:

```console
scp [remote username]@[IP address]:[remote file path]/[file name].txt [local host file path]
```

[local host file path] refers to the location on your host PC which you would like to copy the .txt file to. [remote username] is the SSH username chosen during the [OOBE](https://github.com/microsoft/Project-Santa-Cruz-Private-Preview/blob/main/user-guides/getting_started/oobe.md) setup process. If you did not set up an SSH login during the OOBE, your remote username is root.

For additional information on the Iot Edge commands, please see the [IoT Edge device troubleshooting documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/troubleshoot).

## USB Updating

|Error:                                    |Solution:                                               |
|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
|LIBUSB_ERROR_XXX during USB flash via UUU |This error is the result of a USB connection failure during UUU updating. If the USB cable is not properly connected to the USB ports on the PC or the PE-10X, an error of this form will occur. Try unplugging and replugging both ends of the USB cable and jiggling the cable to ensure a secure connection. This almost always solves the issue. |

## Eye module troubleshooting tips

In case of problems with **WebStreamModule**, ensure that **azureeyemodule**, which does the vision model inferencing, is running. To check the runtime status, go to the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/?feature.canmodifystamps=true&Microsoft_Azure_Iothub=aduprod#home) and navigate to **All resources** -> **\<your IoT hub>** -> **IoT Edge** -> **\<your device ID>**. Click the **Modules** tab to see the runtime status of all installed modules.

![runtime_status](https://github.com/microsoft/Project-Santa-Cruz-Private-Preview/blob/main/user-guides/updating/images/ota_iot_edge_device_page.png)

If the runtime status of **azureeyemodule** is not listed as **running**, click **Set modules** -> **azureeyemodule**. On the **Module Settings** page, set **Desired Status** to **running** and click **Update**.

## View device RTSP video stream

View your device's RTSP video stream through the [Project Santa Cruz portal](https://github.com/microsoft/Project-Santa-Cruz-Private-Preview/blob/main/user-guides/prototyping/how-tos/vision/vision_view_video-stream.md) or [VLC media player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html).

To open the RTSP stream in VLC media player, go to **Media** -> **Open network stream** -> **rtsp://[device IP address]/result.
