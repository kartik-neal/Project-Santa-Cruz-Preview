# Connect to your Project Santa Cruz devkit through SSH or serial

Follow the steps below to set up an SSH or serial connection to your Project Santa Cruz Development Kit through [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html).

## Prerequisites

- [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)
- Host PC
- Project Santa Cruz Development Kit
- [USB to TTL serial cable](https://www.adafruit.com/product/954) (for serial connection only)

## SSH into the devkit

1. Power on your device.

1. If your device is not connected to a network over Ethernet or Wi-Fi (set up through the [OOBE](https://github.com/microsoft/Project-Santa-Cruz-Private-Preview/blob/main/user-guides/getting_started/oobe.md)), open your network and internet settings and connect to the devkit's SoftAP hotspot:

    1. SSID: scz-xxxx (where xxxx = the last four digits of the devkit's WiFi MAC address)
    1. password = santacruz

    > [!NOTE]
    > The password listed above is for the default SoftAP (for builds released prior to 12/08/2020). If you set your SoftAP password through the [OOBE](https://github.com/microsoft/Project-Santa-Cruz-Private-Preview/blob/main/user-guides/getting_started/oobe.md), enter that password here. If your device build was released after 12/08/2020 and you did not manually set your SoftAP password, enter the [device-specific, TPM-derived SoftAP password](https://github.com/microsoft/Project-Santa-Cruz-Preview/tree/main/tools/SoftAP-access-info-tool).

1. Open PuTTY. Enter the following and click **Open** to SSH into your devkit:

    1. Host Name: 10.1.1.1
    1. Port: 22
    1. Connection Type: SSH

    > [!NOTE]
    > The **Host Name** is your device's IP address. If your device is connected to the SoftAP, your IP address will be 10.1.1.1. If your device is connected over Ethernet, use the local IP address of the device, which you can get from the Ethernet router or hub. If your device is connected over Wi-Fi, you must use the IP address that was provided during the [OOBE](https://github.com/microsoft/Project-Santa-Cruz-Preview/blob/main/user-guides/getting_started/oobe.md).

1. Log in to the PuTTY terminal. If you set up an SSH username and password during the [OOBE]( https://github.com/microsoft/Project-Santa-Cruz-Private-Preview/blob/main/user-guides/getting_started/oobe.md), enter those login credentials when prompted. Otherwise, enter the following:  

    1. login as: root
    1. Password: p@ssw0rd

## Connect to your devkit over serial

**WARNING!** Do **NOT** attempt to connect your devkit over serial except in extreme failure cases (e.g. you bricked your device). Taking apart the carrier board enclosure to connect the serial cable is very difficult and will break your Wi-Fi antenna cables.

1. Remove the carrier board from the 80/20 rail using the hex key (included in the devkit welcome card).

1. Remove the screws on the underside of the carrier board enclosure and remove the motherboard. **WARNING: this will break your Wi-Fi antenna cables. Do not proceed with the serial connection unless it is the last resort to recover your device.**

1. Remove the heatsink to access the GPIO Pins.

1. Remove the jumper board from the GPIO pins. **Note the direction that the jumper board is plugged in prior to removing it** (e.g. draw an arrow on or attach a sticker to the jumper board pointing towards the circuitry for reference). The jumper board is not keyed and may be accidentally connected backwards when reassembling your carrier board.

1. Connect the [USB to TTL serial cable](https://www.adafruit.com/product/954) to the GPIO pins on the motherboard as shown below. Please note that the red wire is not connected.
    - Connect the black cable (GND) to pin 6.
    - Connect the white cable (RX) to pin 8.
    - Connect the green cable (TX) to pin 10.

1. Power on your devkit and connect the USB side of the serial cable to your PC.

1. In Windows, go to **Start** -> **Windows Update settings** -> **View optional updates** -> **Driver updates**. Look for a Serial to USB update in the list, check the box next to it, and click **Download and Install**.  

1. Next, open the Windows Device Manager (**Start** -> **Device Manager**). Go to **Ports** and click **USB to UART** to open **Properties**. Note which COM port your device is connected to.

1. Click the **Port Settings** tab. Make sure **Bits per second** is set to 115200.

1. Open PuTTY. Enter the following and click **Open** to connect to your devkit via serial:

    1. Serial line: COM[your COM port #]
    1. Speed: 115200
    1. Connection Type: Serial

To update an unbootable device over serial with the [USB to TTL serial cable](https://www.adafruit.com/product/954), please see the [USB update guide for non-standard situations](https://github.com/microsoft/Project-Santa-Cruz-Preview/blob/main/user-guides/updating/usb_updating.md#usb-update-method-3-non-standard-situations).
