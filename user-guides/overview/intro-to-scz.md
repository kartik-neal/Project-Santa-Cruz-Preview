#  What Can AED Do?

Azure Edge Devices (AED) is an Azure-based management tool and a development kit (DevKit) that enables you to rapidly prototype, build, deploy, and manage an application that incorporates user devices with embedded AI. It also provides a way to securely manage the devices on any scale. This is illustrated in the following figure.

Even if you are not an AI expert, you can build, deploy, scale, and manage an Azure application that incorporates AI on remote devices around the world. The ADE dashboard enables you to use off-the-shelf devices that incorporate edge AI into Azure cloud-based applications that span the globe. 

The AED toolset gives you what you with no-code, low-code, and expert-level rapid prototyping capabilities for creating proof of concept (PoC) applications for validation. It can then help you move your PoC apps into production, and scale the apps from small-scale deployments to worldwide information systems. The management tools included in AED enable you to authorize, deauthorize, and update all of the devices in the system you're building - even at the enterprise level. In addition, AED gives you end-to-end encryption to ensure that your information, and that of your customers, is kept secure.

## Off-the Shelf Hardware

AED has a hardware certification program that enables independent hardware vendors (IHVs) to qualify their vision, audio, and sensor hardware to be used in your AI applications. Currently, Microsoft provides two system-on-a-module (SOM) devices that are AED compatible. However, any IHV can get their hardware certified and sell it to customers of Microsoft Azure services.

Microsoft's SOMs, the Eye SOM and the Ear SOM, enable you to build Vision and Speech solutions apps. And because they are compatible with 80/20 T-slot hardware, you can incorporate the Eye and Ear SOMs into virtually anything you want to build. With our end to end experience, you have the option to either build a device using our reference architecture and components or to choose third party hardware that fits your scenario.

## Rapid Prototyping

With the AED portal, you can develop AI solutions even if you don't know how do do AI programming. AED provides solution templates, ready-made containers, and pre-trained AI models for you to use in your apps. You don't need a complex level of hardware knowledge to deploy your AI solutions to AED-compatible devices. Once you connect your devices to an IoT hub, the AED portal provides an easy-to-use interface for deploying your apps. So there is a very reasonable likelihood that you can create low-code or no-code solutions that don't even need to be trained. 

For more custom solutions, you can use the AED portal, Microsoft Visual Studio, and the AED DevKit to create advanced solutions that you can integrate with any Azure offering that you subscribe to, such as Azure SQL or Azure Blockchain Service. Experienced AI developers can quickly move from PoC to production with sophisticated tools for both development and taking their solution to market.

The availability of no-code, low-code, and completely from-scratch solitions enables you to rapidly prototype your applications and build your PoC demos. This lets you iteratively validate the usefulness or viability of your app. You can  create you PoC app, try it out, and refine it from your experience. When you need to, you can prototype your refined app again and continue until you're staisfied.

## Scalable Deployment

After you've prototyped a solution that you're satisfied with, you can evolve your PoC app into a production-level product. Your product can gather information, take action at the edge of the cloud, track objects, trigger alerts, or move longer-term data into the cloud for further analysis. This analysis can involve small- or large-scale databases that you build with the gathered information. The information that your app gleans gives you new insights into your business and provids you with new opportunities to offer products and services to your customers.

You can readily deploy a small-scale pilot program for testing and refinement, and then move your deployment to the enterprise scale. The provisioning tools are already designed to handle global deployments when you are ready.

## Enterprise-Level Management

Take advantage of AED to easily configure devices in the cloud and deploy applications at scale, avoiding the manual work. Utilizing AED you are able to update the firmware of all of your solution's devices whether the devices number in the dozens or millions. In addition, you can retrain of your AI model, update your solution's business logic on an ongoing basis, and deploy the updated solution across the globe.

## End-to-End Security
AED provides end-to-end security for your edge AI solution. First, AED-compatible devices use a secure boot process to ensure that they aren't tampered with. In addition, AED devices have dedicated security hardware that ensures that only authorized devices can connect to Azure. 

Keeping devices secure and up to date are two of the top needs that developers have in the IoT/Edge space. Therefore, AED devices ship with the ability to be updated remotely from your Azure portal. By automatically updating the firmware, operating system, and applications on the devices connected to your edge AI solution, you can plug security holes as they are found.

To further secure your edge AI solution, AED encrypts all network traffic between the connected edge AI devices and the Azure cloud.
