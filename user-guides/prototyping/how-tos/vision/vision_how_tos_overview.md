# Vision solution how-to guides overview

For an introduction to creating custom no-code vision solutions through the [Project Santa Cruz portal](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2135819), work through this [quickstart guide](https://github.com/microsoft/Project-Santa-Cruz-Private-Preview/blob/main/user-guides/prototyping/create-nocode-vision.md). After completing the quickstart, check out the following how-to guides for additional information on working with Project Santa Cruz vision solutions.

- [View your devkit's RTSP video stream](https://github.com/microsoft/Project-Santa-Cruz-Private-Preview/blob/main/user-guides/prototyping/how-tos/vision/vision_view_video-stream.md). Follow the steps in this article to view the video stream from the Azure Eye SoM of your devkit. If a model has been deployed to your devkit, you will be able to see the model inferencing on the video stream.

- [Deploy a model to your devkit](https://github.com/microsoft/Project-Santa-Cruz-Private-Preview/blob/main/user-guides/prototyping/how-tos/vision/vision-deploy-model.md). Follow this guide to deploy a sample model or an existing [custom no-code vision solution](https://github.com/microsoft/Project-Santa-Cruz-Private-Preview/blob/main/user-guides/prototyping/create-nocode-vision.md) to your devkit.

- [View device telemetry](https://github.com/microsoft/Project-Santa-Cruz-Private-Preview/blob/main/user-guides/prototyping/how-tos/vision/vision-view-telemetry.md). After deploying a model to your devkit, follow the steps in this article to view your device's model inference telemetry.

- [Capture images for a vision project](https://github.com/microsoft/Project-Santa-Cruz-Private-Preview/blob/main/user-guides/prototyping/how-tos/vision/vision-setup-image-capture.md). Follow this guide to capture and store images for a previously created vision solution.

- [Test and retrain a model](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/test-your-model).

- [Improve your model performance](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/getting-started-improving-your-classifier).
