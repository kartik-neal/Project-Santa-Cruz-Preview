# Managing your voice assistant

This article describes configuration of the voice assiztant application. 
For a step-by-step tutorial that guides you through the process of creating a voice assistant, see [QuickStart: Creating a Voice Assistant with the Project Santa Cruz Devkit](../nocode-speech.md).

## Keyword

A keyword is a word or short phrase which allows your product to be voice activated. For example, "Hey Cortana" is the keyword for the Cortana assistant. Voice activation allows your users to start interacting with your product completely hands-free by simply speaking the keyword. As your product continuously listens for the keyword, all audio is processed locally on the user's device until a detection occurs to ensure their data stays as private as possible.
